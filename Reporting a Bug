How to report a bug

Bugs are tracked in the issue list on GitHub. 

Always search for existing issues before filing a new one (use the search field at the top of the page).

When filing a new bug, please include:

    A descriptive title - use descriptive keywords in the title and body so others can find your bug (avoiding duplicates).

    If the problem happens with specific code, link to test files.
   
    Screenshots are very helpful if you're seeing an error message.
